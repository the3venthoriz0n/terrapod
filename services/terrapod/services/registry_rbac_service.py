"""Registry-specific RBAC permission resolution.

Resolves the highest permission level a user has on a registry resource
(module or provider) using the same label-based model as workspaces but
with a simpler three-level hierarchy (no "plan" for registry resources).

Permission hierarchy: read < write < admin
Resolution order: platform admin > audit > owner > label RBAC > everyone > none
