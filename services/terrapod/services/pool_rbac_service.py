"""Agent-pool-specific RBAC permission resolution.

Resolves the highest permission level a user has on an agent pool
using the same label-based model as workspaces and registry resources
but with a simpler three-level hierarchy (no "plan" for pools).

Permission hierarchy: read < write < admin
Resolution order: platform admin > audit > owner > label RBAC > everyone > none
