# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Terrapod uses a label-based RBAC system instead of Terraform Enterprise's team model. Labels replace teams entirely -- a "team" is just a label. This document covers the permission model, role configuration, and common patterns.

---

## Permission Model

### Workspace Permission Levels

Workspace permissions are strictly hierarchical -- each level includes all permissions from the levels below it:

| Level | Grants |
|---|---|
| **read** | View workspace, view runs and plan output, view state metadata, view non-sensitive variables |
| **plan** | read + queue plan-only runs, lock/unlock (own locks), download raw state |
| **write** | plan + confirm/discard applies, create apply runs, CRUD variables, upload state/config, rollback state versions |
| **admin** | write + update/delete workspace, change VCS/execution settings, change labels, delete state versions. Cannot change owner (platform admin only) |

### Registry Permission Levels

Modules and providers use a similar three-level hierarchy (no "plan" concept):

| Level | Grants |
|---|---|
| **read** | View module/provider, download artifacts |
| **write** | read + create versions, upload artifacts |
| **admin** | write + update/delete module/provider, change labels |

A role's `workspace_permission` maps to registry permissions: `plan` maps to `read`.

**Runner tokens** receive implicit `read` access to all registry modules and providers. This allows runner Jobs to download modules and providers during `terraform init` without requiring explicit label-based permissions on each registry resource.

### Pool Permission Levels

Agent pools use a three-level hierarchy (separate from workspace permissions):

| Level | Grants |
|---|---|
| **read** | View pool, list listeners |
| **write** | read + assign pool to workspaces |
| **admin** | write + manage tokens, update/delete pool |

Each custom role has a `pool_permission` field (default: `read`) that is independent of `workspace_permission`. Assigning a pool to a workspace requires **both** `write` on the pool **and** `admin` on the workspace.

Pool permission resolution follows the same order as workspace permissions:

1. **Platform admin** → `admin` on all pools
2. **Platform audit** → `read` on all pools
3. **Pool owner** (`pool.owner_email == user.email`) → `admin`
4. **Label-based RBAC** — custom roles matched against pool labels using `pool_permission`
5. **`everyone` role** — pools with label `access: everyone` → `read`
6. **Default** → no access (pool is invisible)

### Platform Permissions

| Operation | Required Role |
|---|---|
| Manage roles and assignments | `admin` |
| Manage VCS connections | `admin` |
| Create agent pools | `admin` |
| Manage agent pool tokens, update/delete pool | Pool `admin` (owner, platform admin, or role-based) |
| Binary/module/provider cache admin | `admin` |
| View roles, VCS connections | `admin` or `audit` |
| View agent pools | Any authenticated user (filtered by pool RBAC) |
| Create workspaces | Any authenticated user (creator becomes owner) |
| Create registry modules/providers | Any authenticated user (creator becomes owner) |
| Variable sets (create/update/delete) | `admin` |

## Built-in Roles

Terrapod has three built-in roles that cannot be modified or deleted:

| Role | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **admin** | Bypasses all RBAC checks. Full access to every workspace, registry item, and platform operation. |
| **audit** | Read-only access to all workspaces and registry items. Can view (but not modify) roles, VCS connections, and agent pools. |
| **everyone** | Implicit role assigned to all authenticated users. Grants `read` access to workspaces that have the label `access: everyone`. |

---

## Permission Resolution Order

When a user accesses a workspace, permissions are resolved in this order. The first match wins (highest to lowest priority):

```
1. Platform admin?
   YES --> admin permission on ALL workspaces
   NO  --> continue

2. Platform audit?
   YES --> read permission on ALL workspaces
   NO  --> continue

3. Workspace owner? (ws.owner_email == user.email)
   YES --> admin permission on this workspace
   NO  --> continue

4. Label-based RBAC (custom roles):
   For each custom role the user holds:
     a. Check allow rules (labels + names)
     b. Check deny rules (labels + names)
     c. If workspace matches allow AND does NOT match deny:
        collect that role's workspace_permission
   Take the HIGHEST collected permission
   |
   v (if any permission found, use it)

5. "everyone" role:
   If workspace has label "access: everyone" --> read permission
   |
   v (otherwise)

6. Default: no access (403)
```

---

## Custom Roles

Custom roles define access using allow/deny rules on labels and workspace names.

### Creating a Custom Role

```zsh
curl -X POST https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "roles",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "developer",
        "description": "Can plan and write to development workspaces",
        "workspace-permission": "write",
        "allow-labels": {"env": "dev"},
        "allow-names": [],
        "deny-labels": {},
        "deny-names": []
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Role Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Unique role name (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens) |
| `description` | string | Human-readable description |
| `workspace-permission` | string | One of: `read`, `plan`, `write`, `admin` |
| `pool-permission` | string | One of: `read`, `write`, `admin` (default: `read`) |
| `allow-labels` | object | Label key-value pairs that grant access |
| `allow-names` | array | Explicit workspace names that grant access |
| `deny-labels` | object | Label key-value pairs that deny access (overrides allow) |
| `deny-names` | array | Explicit workspace names that deny access (overrides allow) |

### Label Matching Rules

- **Allow labels**: A workspace matches if ANY specified label key-value pair matches (OR across keys)
- **Allow names**: A workspace name must appear in the list to match
- **A workspace matches if it matches allow-labels OR allow-names**
- **Deny labels**: If a workspace has ANY specified deny label, access is denied regardless of allow rules
- **Deny names**: If a workspace name appears in the deny list, access is denied
- **Deny always wins over allow**

### Listing Roles

```zsh
curl https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN"
```

Returns both built-in and custom roles.

### Updating a Role

```zsh
curl -X PATCH https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/roles/developer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "roles",
      "attributes": {
        "workspace-permission": "plan",
        "allow-labels": {"env": "dev", "team": "platform"}
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Deleting a Role

```zsh
curl -X DELETE https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/roles/developer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN"
```

Built-in roles (`admin`, `audit`, `everyone`) cannot be deleted.

---

## Role Assignments

Role assignments bind a user (identified by provider + email) to a role.

### Setting Roles for a User

```zsh
curl -X PUT https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/role-assignments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "role-assignments",
      "attributes": {
        "provider-name": "local",
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "roles": ["developer", "sre-reader"]
      }
    }
  }'
```

For platform roles (admin, audit):

```zsh
curl -X PUT https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/role-assignments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "role-assignments",
      "attributes": {
        "provider-name": "local",
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "roles": ["admin"]
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Listing All Assignments

```zsh
curl https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/role-assignments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN"
```

### Removing a Single Assignment

```zsh
curl -X DELETE https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/role-assignments/local/alice@example.com/developer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN"
```

## Workspace Labels and Ownership

Labels are visible in the workspace overview and can be managed from the workspace settings.

![Workspace Overview with Labels](images/workspace-overview.png)

### Setting Labels on a Workspace

Labels are key-value pairs set on workspace creation or update:

```zsh
curl -X PATCH https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/workspaces/ws-{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "workspaces",
      "attributes": {
        "labels": {
          "env": "production",
          "team": "platform",
          "region": "eu-west-1"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

### Workspace Ownership

- The user who creates a workspace automatically becomes its owner
- Owners have `admin` permission on their workspace
- Only a platform admin can change workspace ownership

### Label Limits

Labels are validated at the API on workspace, agent pool, and registry module/provider create or update. The API returns **422 Unprocessable Entity** if any of the following limits are violated:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Maximum labels per resource | 50 |
| Maximum label key length | 63 characters |
| Maximum label value length | 255 characters |

Keys and values must be strings.

### Reserved Label Keys

A small set of label keys are reserved as **virtual filter fields** in the workspace-list filter UI. A filter term like `status:errored` resolves against a workspace's derived status, not against a literal label called `status`. To keep that filter language unambiguous, these keys cannot be used as literal labels — the API rejects them on create and update with 422.

| Reserved key | Maps to | Filter status |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | derived run status (`errored`, `needs-confirm`, `drifted`, `applied`, …) | implemented |
| `pool` | `agent_pool_name` | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `mode` | `execution_mode` (`local`/`agent`) | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `backend` | `execution_backend` (`tofu`/`terraform`) | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `owner` | `owner_email` | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `drift` | `drift_status` (`drifted`/`in_sync`/`never_checked`) | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `version` | `terraform_version` | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `vcs` | `true`/`false` — has VCS connection | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `locked` | `true`/`false` — currently locked | reserved (planned virtual) |
| `branch` | `vcs_branch` | reserved (planned virtual) |

The set is intentionally aggressive: reserving a key today is near-zero cost (no virtual implementation required), but adding a reservation later — once the key is in customer use as a literal label — is a migration.

If you have an existing label with one of the reserved keys, reads and existing rows continue to work, but the next create or update of that resource that includes the reserved key in its `labels` field will be rejected with a 422 that names the offending key. Migrate by renaming — for example, swap `version: 1.11` for `tf-version: 1.11` (or drop it if the same data is already on `terraform_version`).

The list lives in `terrapod.services.label_validation.RESERVED_LABEL_KEYS`. Adding to it is a behaviour change for any deployment with existing labels using the new key — update both the constant and this table together.

### Labels are also Tags

Workspace labels do double duty: alongside their primary role in label-based RBAC, they also stand in for TFE's "workspace tags" concept on the CLI. The `cloud { workspaces { tags = ... } }` block in your `.tf` config is matched against the same `labels` map.

```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    hostname     = "terrapod.example.com"
    organization = "default"

    workspaces {
      tags = ["core"]                    # all workspaces with label key "core"
      # or
      tags = { repo = "tf-aws-core" }    # all workspaces with label repo=tf-aws-core
    }
  }
}
```

Both forms are accepted:

| Form | Example | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| List, bare key | `tags = ["core"]` | workspaces with label key `core` (any value) |
| List, key=value | `tags = ["env=prod"]` | workspaces with `env: prod` exactly |
| Map | `tags = { env = "prod" }` | workspaces with `env: prod` exactly |

Pick the workspace at run time with `terraform workspace select <name>` or the `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable. This is how a single repo with multiple environments (e.g. `core-dev-eu1`, `core-stg-eu1`, `core-prod-eu1`) can use one `cloud {}` block and pick the env per CLI invocation.

The web UI displays this field as **"Labels (tags)"** to make the dual purpose explicit.

## Self-Lockout Protection on Label Changes

When a user updates labels on a workspace, module, or provider, the API checks whether the new labels would reduce or remove the user's own access. If they would, the API returns **409 Conflict** instead of applying the change, giving the user a chance to reconsider.

### How It Works

1. User submits label changes via `PATCH` on a workspace/module/provider
2. API simulates permission resolution with the proposed new labels
3. If the user's access would drop (e.g. from `write` to `read`, or from `read` to none): **409 Conflict**
4. User can re-submit with `"force": true` in the attributes to confirm the change

### Who Is Immune

- **Platform admins** — their access doesn't depend on labels (always `admin`)
- **Resource owners** — ownership check precedes label check (always `admin`)

The lockout check only fires for users whose access comes from label-based role matching.

### 409 Response Format

```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "status": "409",
    "title": "Label change would reduce your access",
    "detail": "This label change would reduce your access from write to read on this workspace. Re-submit with \"force\": true to confirm."
  }]
}
```

### Force Override

To proceed despite the warning, include `"force": true` in the attributes:

```zsh
curl -X PATCH https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/workspaces/ws-{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "workspaces",
      "attributes": {
        "labels": {"team": "other-team"},
        "force": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

### UX Behavior

In the web UI, when a label change would trigger a lockout warning:
1. A warning banner appears explaining the access reduction
2. The user can choose **Revert Labels** (undo the change) or **Save Anyway** (submit with `force: true`)

---

## Permissions Block in API Responses

Workspace, module, and provider API responses include a `permissions` block that reflects the authenticated user's effective permissions on that resource. The web UI uses this to hide or disable actions the user cannot perform.

### Workspace Permissions

Included in workspace show/list responses:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "can-update": true,
    "can-destroy": true,
    "can-queue-run": true,
    "can-read-state-versions": true,
    "can-create-state-versions": true,
    "can-read-variable": true,
    "can-update-variable": true,
    "can-lock": true,
    "can-unlock": true,
    "can-force-unlock": true,
    "can-read-settings": true
  }
}
```

### Registry Module Permissions

Included in module show/list responses:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "can-update": false,
    "can-destroy": false,
    "can-create-version": true
  }
}
```

### Registry Provider Permissions

Included in provider show/list responses (same shape as modules):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "can-update": false,
    "can-destroy": false,
    "can-create-version": true
  }
}
```

### Permission-to-Level Mapping

| Permission | Workspace Level | Registry Level |
|---|---|---|
| `can-update` | `admin` | `admin` |
| `can-destroy` | `admin` | `admin` |
| `can-queue-run` | `plan` | — |
| `can-lock` / `can-unlock` | `plan` | — |
| `can-force-unlock` | `admin` | — |
| `can-update-variable` | `write` | — |
| `can-create-version` | — | `write` |
| `can-read-*` | `read` | `read` |

### UX Permission Gating

The web UI hides or disables controls based on these permission flags:

| UI Element | Permission | When False |
|---|---|---|
| Delete Workspace/Module/Provider | `can-destroy` | Hidden |
| Lock/Unlock button | `can-lock` | Hidden |
| Queue Plan button | `can-queue-run` | Hidden |
| Add/Edit/Delete Variable | `can-update-variable` | Hidden |
| Settings edit fields | `can-update` | Read-only |
| Add/Edit/Delete Notification | `can-update` | Hidden |
| Add/Delete Run Task | `can-update` | Hidden |
| Labels editor | `can-update` | Read-only |
| Drift detection toggle | `can-update` | Read-only badge |
| Check Drift Now | `can-queue-run` | Hidden |
| Upload Version / Add Platform | `can-create-version` | Hidden |
| Edit metadata | `can-update` | Hidden |

---

## API Token Role Resolution

When an API token is used for authentication, the user's roles are resolved from:

1. `role_assignments` table (custom roles mapped to provider + email)
2. `platform_role_assignments` table (platform roles: admin, audit)

Results are cached in Redis (`tp:token_roles:{email}`, 60-second TTL) to avoid repeated database queries.

---

## Example Configurations

### Environment-Based Access

Separate read/write access by environment:

```
Role: "dev-writer"
  workspace-permission: write
  allow-labels: { "env": "dev" }

Role: "staging-planner"
  workspace-permission: plan
  allow-labels: { "env": "staging" }

Role: "prod-reader"
  workspace-permission: read
  allow-labels: { "env": "production" }
```

Workspaces:
- `my-app-dev` with labels `{ "env": "dev" }`
- `my-app-staging` with labels `{ "env": "staging" }`
- `my-app-prod` with labels `{ "env": "production" }`

A user with roles `dev-writer` and `staging-planner` can:
- Read, plan, and write to `my-app-dev`
- Read and plan on `my-app-staging`
- No access to `my-app-prod`

### Team-Based Access with Production Exclusion

```
Role: "platform-team"
  workspace-permission: write
  allow-labels: { "team": "platform" }
  deny-labels: { "env": "production" }

Role: "platform-prod"
  workspace-permission: write
  allow-labels: { "team": "platform", "env": "production" }
```

Assign `platform-team` to all platform engineers. Assign `platform-prod` only to senior engineers who need production write access.

### Named Workspace Access

Grant access to specific workspaces by name:

```
Role: "networking-admin"
  workspace-permission: admin
  allow-names: ["vpc-primary", "vpc-secondary", "dns-zones"]
  deny-names: []
```

### Read-Only Audit Access for Everyone

Use the built-in `everyone` role with the `access: everyone` label:

```zsh
# Set label on workspace
curl -X PATCH https://terrapod.example.com/api/v2/workspaces/ws-{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TERRAPOD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "workspaces",
      "attributes": {
        "labels": {
          "access": "everyone"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Now all authenticated users can view this workspace.

### Role Assignment via OIDC Groups

Configure your OIDC provider to include group claims, then map them to Terrapod roles:

```yaml
oidc:
  - name: okta
    groups_claim: "groups"
    role_prefixes: ["terrapod:"]
    claims_to_roles:
      - claim: groups
        value: "TerrapodAdmins"
        roles: ["admin"]
      - claim: groups
        value: "PlatformEngineers"
        roles: ["platform-team"]
      - claim: groups
        value: "SRE"
        roles: ["platform-team", "platform-prod"]
```

With `role_prefixes: ["terrapod:"]`, an IDP group named `terrapod:developer` automatically maps to the Terrapod role `developer` without needing an explicit `claims_to_roles` entry.
